.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dropbear
is a SSH 2 server designed to be small enough to be used in small memory
environments, while still being functional and secure enough for general use.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b \fIbanner
bannerfile.
Display the contents of the file
.I banner
before user login (default: none).
.TP
.B \-d \fIdsskey
dsskeyfile.
Use the contents of the file
.I dsskey
for the DSS host key (default: /etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key). 
Note that 
some SSH implementations
use the term "DSA" rather than "DSS", they mean the same thing.
This file is generated with
.BR dropbearkey (8).
.TP
.B \-r \fIrsakey
rsakeyfile.
Use the contents of the file
.I rsakey
for the rsa host key (default: /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key).
This file is generated with
.BR dropbearkey (8).
.TP
.B \-F
Don't fork into background.
.TP
.B \-E
Log to standard error rather than syslog.
.TP
.B \-m
Don't display the message of the day on login.
.TP
.B \-w
Disallow root logins.
.TP
.B \-s
Disable password logins.
.TP
.B \-g
Disable password logins for root.
.TP
.B \-j
Disable local port forwarding.
.TP
.B \-k
Disable remote port forwarding.
.TP
.B \-p \fI[address:]port
Listen on specified 
.I address
and TCP
.I port.
If just a port is given listen
on all addresses.
up to 10 can be specified (default 22 if none specified).
.TP
.B \-i
Service program mode.
Use this option to run
.B dropbear
under TCP/IP servers like inetd, tcpsvd, or tcpserver.
In program mode the \-F option is implied, and \-p options are ignored.
.TP
.B \-P \fIpidfile
Specify a pidfile to create when running as a daemon. If not specified, the 
default is /var/run/dropbear.pid
.TP
.B \-a
Allow remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.
.TP
.B \-W \fIwindowsize
Specify the per-channel receive window buffer size. Increasing this 
may improve network performance at the expense of memory use. Use -h to see the
default buffer size.
.TP
.B \-K \fItimeout_seconds
Ensure that traffic is transmitted at a certain interval in seconds. This is
useful for working around firewalls or routers that drop connections after
a certain period of inactivity. The trade-off is that a session may be
closed if there is a temporary lapse of network connectivity. A setting
if 0 disables keepalives.
.TP
.B \-I \fIidle_timeout
Disconnect the session if no traffic is transmitted or received for \fIidle_timeout\fR seconds.
.SH FILES

.TP
Authorized Keys

~/.ssh/authorized_keys can be set up to allow remote login with a RSA or DSS
key. Each line is of the form
.TP
[restrictions] ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIgAsp... [comment]

and can be extracted from a Dropbear private host key with "dropbearkey -y". This is the same format as used by OpenSSH, though the restrictions are a subset (keys with unknown restrictions are ignored).
Restrictions are comma separated, with double quotes around spaces in arguments.
Available restrictions are:

.TP
.B no-port-forwarding
Don't allow port forwarding for this connection

.TP
.B no-agent-forwarding
Don't allow agent forwarding for this connection

.TP
.B no-X11-forwarding
Don't allow X11 forwarding for this connection

.TP
.B no-pty
Disable PTY allocation. Note that a user can still obtain most of the
same functionality with other means even if no-pty is set.

.TP
.B command="\fIforced_command\fR"
Disregard the command provided by the user and always run \fIforced_command\fR.

The authorized_keys file and its containing ~/.ssh directory must only be
writable by the user, otherwise Dropbear will not allow a login using public
key authentication.

.TP
Host Key Files

Host key files are read at startup from a standard location, by default
/etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key and /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key
or specified on the commandline with -d or -r. These are of the form generated
by dropbearkey.

.TP
Message Of The Day

By default the file /etc/motd will be printed for any login shell (unless 
disabled at compile-time). This can also be disabled per-user
by creating a file ~/.hushlogin .
